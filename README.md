## Stills

### Primitive Mine

It features a mine cart filled with colorful blocks representing various minerals, a pile of angular rocks, and a wooden ladder structure. The lighting highlights the mine entrance, creating depth through shadows.*

### Project Engineering
*In this Blender scene, I recreated an office environment inspired by my internship at Largo Concrete as a project engineer. The scene features a desk with a detailed structural drawing, accompanied by essential drafting tools like a protractor and slide ruler. Vintage tools were added to evoke the aesthetics of civil engineering in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Various documents and a vintage lamp add to the ambiance, creating a realistic setting reminiscent of the era.*

### The Unusual Teapot
*In this Blender scene, I experimented with geometry nodes to create star particle effects, enhancing the overall atmosphere of the environment. I drew direct inspiration from the Season 4 intro of the Twilight Zone television show, aiming to capture its surreal and otherworldly feel.*
